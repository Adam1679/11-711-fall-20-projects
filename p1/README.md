# P1
The entry point for this project is `pset1.ipynb`. It is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and we recommend installing [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install.html) to run it. You can find a preview of the notebook [here](https://github.com/slab-cmu/11-711-fall-20-projects/blob/master/p1/pset1.ipynb).

Remember this is an individual project so you should not share your code publicly. E.g., it is not allowed to fork the public repo and push your progress there since others may see it.

You will submit the required tarball on Canvas. Feel free to post on Piazza if you have any questions.
